# Opwell Asset Management System

A full-stack application for managing industrial assets, built with Node.js, Express, TypeORM, and Next.js.

> **Note**: This project serves as a technical challenge for candidates applying to Opwell.

# Introduction

Opwell is a company focused on empowering the industrial sector through advanced technology and AI-driven solutions. One of its core services is asset management, which involves maintaining an accurate and structured inventory of industrial facilities, equipment, and parts, along with the necessary documentation for effective maintenance and operation.

This repository contains a sample application designed to simulate that functionality. It allows users to manage an inventory of:

- Plants – physical sites or facilities
- Areas – subdivisions within plants
- Equipment – machines or devices located in areas
- Parts – electrical, electronic, mechanical, or hydraulic components installed in equipment

Each of these entities is fully manageable through CRUD operations, and the application provides intuitive filtering and navigation between them. The frontend is built with Next.js and styled using Ant Design, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and TSOA to expose a typed REST API.

This project demonstrates how asset data can be modeled and interacted with in a scalable, maintainable way—an important step toward smarter, more efficient industrial operations.

## Requirements

- Node.js v20 or higher
- Yarn package manager

## Overview

This application provides a comprehensive solution for managing industrial assets across multiple plants. It allows users to track plants, areas within plants, equipment within areas, and parts within equipment. The system supports CRUD operations for all entities and provides filtering capabilities to easily find specific assets.

## Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeORM for database operations, and TSOA for API generation
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React, Ant Design for UI components, and React Query for data fetching
- **Database**: SQLite (for simplicity, can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL for production)

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of all assets with quick access to detailed views
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete all entities
- **Filtering**: Filter assets by various properties
- **Navigation**: Seamless navigation between related entities (e.g., from plants to areas)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Backend Implementation

### Technologies

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **Express**: Web framework
- **TypeORM**: Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database operations
- **TSOA**: TypeScript OpenAPI for API generation
- **SQLite**: Database (for development, can be replaced with PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **TypeScript**: Programming language

## Database Schema

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Plant ||--o{ Area : "has many"
    Area ||--o{ Equipment : "has many"
    Equipment ||--o{ Part : "has many"

    Plant {
        string id PK "uuid"
        string name
        string address
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    Area {
        string id PK "uuid"
        string name
        string locationDescription
        string plantId FK
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    Equipment {
        string id PK "uuid"
        string name
        string manufacturer
        string serialNumber
        date initialOperationsDate
        string areaId FK
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }

    Part {
        string id PK "uuid"
        string name
        enum type "ELECTRIC|ELECTRONIC|MECHANICAL|HYDRAULICAL"
        string manufacturer
        string serialNumber
        date installationDate
        string equipmentId FK
        datetime createdAt
        datetime updatedAt
    }
```

The diagram shows the relationships between the main entities in the system:

- A **Plant** can have multiple **Areas**
- An **Area** can have multiple pieces of **Equipment**
- A piece of **Equipment** can have multiple **Parts**

Each entity has timestamps (`createdAt` and `updatedAt`) for auditing purposes. The relationships are enforced through foreign keys, ensuring data integrity across the system.
